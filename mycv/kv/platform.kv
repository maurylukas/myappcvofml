You control one of our team members that is late to class and, by the time he arrives, the college is overrun by creatures bearing our professor's faces. None other than Mario himself explains to you that all of the characters from games made by the students and installed in the college computers have escaped, except for a powerful one that stayed behind and turned all of our professors into enemy sprites to be battled with before finally facing him."
